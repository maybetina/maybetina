Hello! I'm Christina (Tina).

My journey with video games started in childhood and deepened as I began learning Japanese four years ago, immersing myself in the culture through language and events like Bunkasai at school. This love for both games and Japanese culture inspired me to pursue a degree in Multimedia and Computer Graphics at New Bulgarian University, where I am currently studying game development.

Alongside my degree, I am advancing my programming skills through Udemy courses in C#, building a strong foundation for creating interactive and engaging games. I’m passionate about blending storytelling, culture, and technology in innovative ways—and I look forward to sharing my projects and growth here.
